- Deserialise the json and represent it in a list - Title, poster, rating.
- Items in the list should lead you to a movie details page
- Any effort towards building a better UI/UX experience will be considered an advantage

## Level 2

After completing the required tasks in the first level, you can continue with next-level tasks. Every task in this list will give you bonus points.
